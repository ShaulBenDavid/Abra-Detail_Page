            <p class="detail">Building efficient web and mobile interfaces is often challenging and requires the use of
                imperative logic. React enables you to declaratively describe user interfaces in terms of
                their state, and it will do the heavy lifting of natively building them for you. In this
                course, React: Getting Started, you will delve into the fundamental concepts about React
                and use them to build practical web applications.</p>
            <h4 class="sub-detail">You have a unique opportunity to take all the knowledge,
                experience and professionalism you have accumulated and 
                leverage them into the high-tech world.</h4>
